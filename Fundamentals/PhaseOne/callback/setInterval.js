// In this challenge you'll need to use the function setInterval. 
// It works the same way as setTimeout, but rather than executing the given function once after a delay, it executes it repeatedly. 
// For example, if we give 2000 for the number of milliseconds, the function will execute every 2 seconds:

setInterval(myFunction, 2000); // myFunction will execute every 2 seconds
