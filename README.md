# JavaScript_Fundamentals

Learning objectives

Test-drive a simple Javascript program using Node.
Explain how asynchronous programming is different from synchronous, blocking programming.
Apply a coherent process to learn a new language.
Outline

Phase One

Work through these exercises designed to train the basics of JavaScript. If you already know JavaScript or you feel like a challenge, feel free to skip a few of these steps.

Running JavaScript
Running files
Variables and visibility
Functions
Conditionals
Loops
Functions as values
Callbacks
Arrays
Objects
Array operations
Classes
Phase Two

Work through challenges designed to help you learn how to use JavaScript in a real application, including unit tests, multiple classes, and external dependencies on packages and remote APIs.

Testing with Jest
A Search function
A Shopping basket
A Thermostat
A Pokédex
A Weather client
A Web server
Most people won't complete all of this and that is OK.
